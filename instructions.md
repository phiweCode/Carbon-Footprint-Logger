Real-World Build 1: Footprint Logger UI

Scenario:
You've been approached by a local environmental group to help individuals track their daily activities that contribute to carbon emissions. They want a simple and clean web app that lets users log their behaviours and see a summary of their estimated carbon footprint. A carbon footprint is the amount of CO₂ released by your daily activities, like travel or energy use.

Your Task:

Build a front-end app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to:

    ● Select or input daily activities (e.g., car travel, meat consumption, electricity use)
    ● Automatically assign a CO₂ value to each activity
    ● View a running total of emissions
    ● Display a visual summary (e.g., a bar or pie chart)
    ● Filter activities by category (e.g., food, transport, energy)
    ● Use localStorage to save data between sessions

Submission Instructions:
Please be sure to push your code to a public GitHub repository and submit the repo link on Google Classroom for grading.
